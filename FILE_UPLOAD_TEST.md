### ðŸ”§ Debugging Tips

#### Check Browser Console
- Look for file upload related logs
- Check for API errors
- Verify file processing messages

#### Network Tab
- Monitor file upload requests
- Check API calls to OpenAI/Gemini
- Verify file data is being sent correctly

#### Common Issues
1. **File not uploading**: Check file size and type restrictions
2. **AI not responding to images**: Verify API keys are configured
3. **Preview not showing**: Check browser file API support
4. **Upload button missing**: Verify component is properly imported

### ðŸ“Š Expected Results
